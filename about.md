Father, Husband, Author, Mathematician, Spaniard, U.S. Permanent Resident
===

Originally from Spain, I spent a few years in Indiana pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Purdue University.  After graduation, I moved down South, to join the University of South Carolina.

When I am not working, I delve into any of my multiple hobbies.

+ I am crazy for the *outdoors*: *swimming*, *hiking*, *camping*, some *rock climbing* and *bouldering* are my favorite activities while at the mountains.  

> As a matter of fact, I met my wife in a climbing trip to the walls of Looking Glass Rock, in the Pisgah National Forest near Brevard, in North Carolina.  We married a few years after that adventure.

+ We have a (very energetic) *dog* and a (very independent) *cat*.
+ I practice *Shotokan karate*.
+ I played *tennis* competitively in high school.  I played *racquetball* and *handball* for fun when I came to the States.
+ In school and college, I played competitively *soccer*, *rugby*, and less seriously, *basketball*.
+ I don't watch much TV but when I do, it is mostly to watch soccer or *movies*.  I have a decent collection of movies in DVD---about 500 titles.
+ I enjoy *growing plants at home*, and aspire to build a decent nursery where I can bring some exotic ones from Asia; and Central and South America.
+ I devour all *Science Fiction* (let it be a good book, a good movie, or a show on TV).  I aim to finish a list of about 2000 science fiction books.
+ I played *chess* competitively during college, and at the same time taught this discipline in different middle and high schools in Madrid,  I lately learned some *go*, but realized that one must devote long hours of study to become *decent* at it.  I am fond of other board games, although I am not very knowledgeable in this area.
+ Not too crazy about computer gaming, although I have a soft spot for *civilization games*.
+ Although far from a good cook, I thoroughly enjoy *cooking*, especially Spanish cuisine and learning new recipes from other cultures.
+ Occasionally, I delve into creating *origami* animals for fun.  I learned the basic folds from my father long time ago, and some more complex shapes from a few books.  Sometime in the near future I will find enough time to get to learn the pinnacle of Spanish **Papiroflexia:** a *bullfighter with a bull* from a single rectangular piece of paper!
+ I thoroughly enjoy learning new *languages*.  I am only fluent in *Spanish* and *English*.  I have a decent reading comprehension of *French*, *Italian*, *Catalan* and *German*, although I cannot speak it or follow conversations all that well.  I have recently started to learn some *Chinese*, and I find it fascinating.  At some point in the past I attempted some *Korean* (when I had the luxury of Korean office mates) but I didn't get too far, unfortunately.
