<h1 id="father-husband-author-mathematician-spaniard-us-permanent-resident">Father, Husband, Author, Mathematician, Spaniard, U.S. Permanent Resident</h1>

<p>Originally from Spain, I spent a few years in Indiana pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at Purdue University.  After graduation, I moved to South Carolina for professional reasons.  An amateur boulderer (see below), I met my wife in a climbing trip to the walls of Looking glass.  We married a few years after that adventurous encounter, and now have a beautiful daughter.  Following a promise I made to myself a few years back, I wrote a book to coincide with the birth of my first born.  This book—a technical monograph on the usage of python for mathematical and engineering purposes—has been recently published, and very well received by the scientific community.</p>

<p>When I am not working, I delve into any of my multiple hobbies.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have a (very energetic) <em>dog</em> and a (very independent) <em>cat</em>.</li>
  <li>I practice <em>Shotokan karate</em>.</li>
  <li>I played <em>tennis</em> competitively in high school.  I played <em>racquetball</em> and <em>handball</em> for fun when I came to the States.</li>
  <li>In school and college, I played competitively <em>soccer</em>, <em>rugby</em>, and less seriously, <em>basketball</em>.</li>
  <li>I don’t watch much TV but when I do, it is mostly to watch soccer or <em>movies</em>.  I have a decent collection of movies in DVD—about 500 titles.</li>
  <li>I am crazy for the <em>outdoors</em>: <em>swimming</em>, <em>hiking</em>, <em>camping</em>, some <em>rock climbing</em> and <em>bouldering</em> are my favorite activities while at the mountains.</li>
  <li>I enjoy <em>growing plants at home</em>, and aspire to build a decent nursery where I can bring some exotic ones from Asia; and Central and South America.</li>
  <li>I devour all <em>Science Fiction</em> (let it be a good book, a good movie, or a show on TV).  I aim to finish a list of about 2000 science fiction books.</li>
  <li>I played <em>chess</em> competitively during college, and at the same time taught this discipline in different middle and high schools in Madrid,  I lately learned some <em>go</em>, but realized that one must devote long hours of study to become <em>decent</em> at it.  I am fond of other board games, although I am not very knowledgeable in this area.</li>
  <li>Not too crazy about computer gaming, although I have a soft spot for <em>civilization games</em>.</li>
  <li>Although far from a good cook, I thoroughly enjoy <em>cooking</em>, especially Spanish cuisine and learning new recipes from other cultures.</li>
  <li>Occasionally, I delve into creating <em>origami</em> animals for fun.  I learned the basic folds from my father long time ago, and some more complex shapes from a few books.  Sometime in the near future I will find enough time to get to learn the pinnacle of Spanish <strong>Papiroflexia:</strong> a <em>bullfighter with a bull</em> from a single rectangular piece of paper!</li>
  <li>I thoroughly enjoy learning new <em>languages</em>.  I am only fluent in <em>Spanish</em> and <em>English</em>.  I have a decent reading comprehension of <em>French</em>, <em>Italian</em>, <em>Catalan</em> and <em>German</em>, although I cannot speak it or follow conversations all that well.  I have recently started to learn some <em>Chinese</em>, and I find it fascinating.  At some point in the past I started learning some <em>Korean</em> (when I had the luxury of Korean office mates) but I didn’t get too far, unfortunately.</li>
