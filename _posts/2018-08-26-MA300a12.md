## Negating Statements

<div class="alert alert-info">
	The following is the list of problems for Section 2.10 of the <em>Book of Proof</em> (page 60).  There is a forum open at the end, so you can ask questions.  It is a great way to interact with the instructor and with other students in your class, should you need some assistance with any question. Please, <strong>do not post solutions</strong>.

Negate the following sentences.

1. The number \\( x \\) is positive but the number \\( y \\) is not positive.
2. If \\( x \\) is prime then \\( \sqrt{x} \\) is not a rational number.
3. For every prime number \\( p \\) there is another prime number \\( q \\) with \\( q > p \\).
4. For every positive number \\( \varepsilon \\), there is a positive number \\( \delta \\) for which \\( \lvert x - \alpha \rvert < \delta \\) implies \\( \lvert f(x) - f(\alpha) \rvert < \varepsilon \\).
5. For every positive number \\( \varepsilon \\) there is a positive number \\( M \\) for which \\( \lvert f(x) - b \rvert < \varepsilon \\), whenever \\( x > M \\).
6. There exists a real number \\( a \\) for which \\( a + x = x \\) for every real number \\( x \\).
7. I don't eat anything that has a face.
8. If \\( x \\) is a rational number and \\( x \neq 0 \\) then \\( \tan(x) \\) is not a rational number.
9. If \\( \sin(x) < 0 \\), then it is not the case that \\( 0 \leq x \leq \pi \\).
10. If \\( f \\) is a polynomial and its degree is greater than 2, then \\( f' \\) is not constant.
11. You can fool all of the people all of the time.
12. Whenever I have to choose between two evils, I choose the one I haven't tried yet.  (Mae West)
