## Statements

<div class="alert alert-info">
	The following is the list of problems for Section 2.1 of the <em>Book of Proof</em> (page 37).  There is a forum open at the end, so you can ask questions.  It is a great way to interact with the instructor and with other students in your class, should you need some assistance with any question. Please, <strong>do not post solutions</strong>.
