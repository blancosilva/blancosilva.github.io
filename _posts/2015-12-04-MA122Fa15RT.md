<div class="well">
	This is a good review test.  I am missing a couple of topics, but your choices made a lot of sense.  They are also very similar to what is offered in both the textbook and the homework online.  Good job. <br />

	There were several people that wrote questions from repeated topics.  Those students will accordingly not receive any credit.
</div>
