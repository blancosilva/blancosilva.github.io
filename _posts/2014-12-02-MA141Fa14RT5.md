	<h3>Sections 11 and 12</h3>
	Nice selection of problems, with balanced difficulty from very easy to boss level.  I am missing some nice problems of sequences — remember that there will be some of those in the final exam!  The problems with series are cool, though. <br />

	Some of the integrals are extremely tricky, and as a matter of fact, there is one that I don't believe anybody can get — unless you use some techniques of integration that we have not learned in this first approach to Calculus.  <br />

	I decided to let that one evil integral in the exam, to torture all y'all.  <br />

	Oh wait!  You guys know about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com">wolframalpha</a>... Nevermind
</div>

1. Compute the derivative of the following functions:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		k(x) &= \int_{3x}^{9x} \frac{z^2-7}{z^2+7}\, dz \\
		g(x) &= \int_0^x \sqrt{1+t^2}\, dt  \\
		f(x) &= \int_0^{x^2} \sin t\, dt	
		\end{align}
	</div>

2. Compute the following limit:
	<div>
		\begin{equation}
		\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{6}{n} \bigg[ \big(\frac{2i}{n} \big)^2 + 5 \big(\frac{2i}{n}\big) \bigg]	
		\end{equation}
	</div>

3. Employ the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the following definite integrals:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		\int_1^2 \frac{4+u^2}{u^3}\, du &&& \int_6^8 x^4 + 20x^2 +10\, dt
		\end{align}
	</div>

4. Compute the following indefinite integrals:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		&\int \sin x + 2\tan x\, dx && \int \sec^2 x + \cos x - \cot x\, dx \\
		&\int \big( x-\tfrac{1}{x} \big)\, dx && \int e^{5x+8}\, dx \\
		&\int \frac{1}{x\ln x}\, dx && \int \frac{2x^6 + 8}{(7x^7 + 8x)^3}\, dx
		\end{align}
	</div>


5. Find the net area of the following functions, in the indicated intervals:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		f(x) &= \lvert x \rvert && [-1, 3] \\
		f(x) &= \sin x && [0, 2\pi]	
		\end{align}
	</div>

6. Find the sum of the following series:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		\sum_{n=1}^{300} 4n^3-6n+18 &&& \sum_{n=1}^{3000} \frac{n^3-4n^2+3n-7}{15}
		\end{align}
	</div>

	<h3>Sections 15 and 16</h3>
	This is a more complete and thorough review exam for this part of the course.  I am still missing some nice problems with sequences — we only have one, from Tierra. I am missing maybe a net area problem, but that is not so terrible, because you posted a decent selection of definite integrals.<br />

	Except for those missing problems, I have to say that this exam is very close to the level of difficulty and volume of questions that you are to expect in my final.  Good job! <br />

	And there was also two students in this section that came up with really evil integral.  One of them is doable with substitution, but it takes a trick we haven't learned yet — you will see it in MA142, though.  See if you spot it!  The other two... not so much.  They were so extremely hard, that I had to take them out of this review test.
</div>

1. Find the next three terms, and the general term of the sequence that starts as <span>\\( -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, -\frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{8}, \dotsc \\)</span>.

2. Evaluate the following limit:
	<div>
		\begin{equation}
		\lim_{n\to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \bigg[ \big(\frac{i}{n} \big)^2 + \frac{i}{n} \bigg]	
		\end{equation}
	</div>

3. Compute the following sums:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		\sum_{k=1}^{200} 7k^3 - 3k^2 + 15 &&& \sum_{n=1}^{1000} (4n+n)(2n^2+7)	
		\end{align}
	</div>

4. Compute the following integrals:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		&\int 3x^3+2x+5+\frac{6}{x^2}\, dx && \int \frac{1}{4}x^2+\frac{2}{3}x+\frac{19}{7}\, dx \\
		&\int e^x \sin( e^x) \, dx && \int \frac{( \ln x )^2}{x} \, dx \\
		&\int_1^e \frac{1}{4x}\, dx && \int_1^2 \frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}\, dx \\
		&\int \sqrt{18x} + 89\sin x\, dx && \int \sin^3 x\, dx \\
		&\int_1^{2e} \frac{5\ln x}{3x}\, dx && \int \frac{186\cos x}{34 \sin x}\, dx \\
		&\int (6x-4)(3x^2-4x)^3\, dx && \int\frac{523x^2}{(4x^3-7)^{1/5}}\, dx \\
		&\int \frac{24x^3-15x}{2x^4-5x}\, dx
		\end{align}
	</div>

5. Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find the derivative of the following functions:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		f(x) &= \int_{x^3+4x+\ln x}^{2x^2+4x+e^x} \sin t\, dt \\
		f(x) &= \int_{5001}^{\ln x + 4^x-17} e^x+10\, dt \\
		g(x) &= \int_x^3 \sin\big(\sqrt{6t}\big)\, dt \\
		g(x) &= \int_{e^x}^2 3\sin^8 t\, dt
		\end{align}
	</div>
