If you have been following this blog for a while, you already know of my fascination with <a href="http://blancosilva.wordpress.com/puzzles/metapuzzles/">metapuzzles</a>. I have recently found one of the most beautiful examples of these riddles in this August's edition of <a href="http://domino.research.ibm.com/Comm/wwwr_ponder.nsf/pages/index.html">Ponder This</a>, and following the advice of Travis, I will leave it completely open for the readers to give it a go. Enjoy!

<div class="well">
A mathematician wanted to teach his children the value of cooperation, so he told them the following:

&laquo;I chose a secret triangle for which the lengths of its sides are all integers.

To you my dear son Charlie, I am giving the triangle's perimeter. And to you, my beloved daughter Ariella, I am giving its area.

Since you are both such talented mathematicians, I'm sure that together you can find the lengths of the triangle's sides.&raquo;

Instead of working together, Charlie and Ariella had the following conversation after their father gave each of them the information he promised.

<strong>Charlie:</strong> "Alas, I cannot deduce the lengths of the sides from my knowledge of the perimeter."

<strong>Ariella:</strong> "I do not know the perimeter, but I cannot deduce the lengths of the sides from just knowing the area. Maybe our father is right and we should cooperate after all."

<strong>Charlie:</strong> "Oh no, no need. Now I know the lengths of the sides."

<strong>Ariella:</strong> "Well, now I know them as well."

Find the lengths of the triangle's sides.
