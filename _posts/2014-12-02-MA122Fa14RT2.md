	Assessment 
</div>

1. What is the effect of the operation <span>\\( -f(x)+3 \\)</span> on the graph of the function <span>\\( f(x) \\)</span>?
2. Write the expression of a function obtained by vertically stretching the graph of <span>\\( y=x^4 \\)</span> by a factor of 3, followed by a horizontal shift left of 2 units.
3. Is the function <span>\\( f(x) = (5x)^3 \\)</span> a power function?  If so, write it in the form <span>\\( f(x) = K x^n \\)</span>.
4. Estimate the instantaneous rate of change of the function <span>\\( f(x)=x\ln x \\)</span> between <span>\\( x=1 \\)</span> and <span>\\( x=2 \\)</span>. 
5. Find the derivative of the following functions:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		p(t) &= e^{0.03t} \\
		f(x) &= 2(3x+5)^3 \\	
		f(x) &= (x-7x^7)(\sqrt{x}+5) \\
		f(x) &= \frac{12x^2}{4x^3+7} \\
		f(x) &= 7^x + 2x^4 \\
		C(t) &= \frac{e^{2t}}{t}
		\end{align}
	</div>
6. Compute the second derivative of <span>\\( h(x) = \ln (3x^2-4) \\)</span>.
7. The following table gives the percentage of the US population in urban areas as a function of the year

	<div style="text-align:center;">
		<table class="table table-border">
			<tr>
				<td>Year</td><td>1800</td><td>1830</td><td>1860</td><td>1890</td><td>1920</td><td>1950</td><td>1980</td><td>1990</td><td>2000</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Percentage</td><td>6.9</td><td>8.7</td><td>17.4</td><td>36.0</td><td>51.5</td><td>66.8</td><td>73.7</td><td>75.7</td><td>80.1</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div>
	
	    * Find the average rate of change of the percentage of population living in urban areas from 1890 to 1990.
	    * Estimate the rate at which this percentage is increasing in 1990.
	    * Estimate the rate of change of this function for the year 1830, and explain what this means.
	    * Is this an increasing or decreasing function?
8. Use a small interval (<span>\\( x=2 \\)</span> to <span>\\( x=2.01 \\)</span>) to estimate <span>\\( f'(2) \\)</span>.
9. Find an equation of the tangent line to the graph of <span>\\( f(x) = x^2e^{-x} \\)</span> at <span>\\( x=0 \\)</span>.
10. The quantity demanded of a certain product, <span>\\( q \\)</span>, is given in terms of the price <span>\\( p \\)</span>, by the formula
	<div>
		\begin{equation}
		q = 1000e^{-0.02p}	
		\end{equation}
	</div>
    * Write the revenue <span>\\( R \\)</span>, as a function of the price.
    * Find the rate of change of the revenue with respect to the price.
    * Find revenue and rate of change of revenue with respect to price, when the price is $10.  Interpret this answer in financial terms.
