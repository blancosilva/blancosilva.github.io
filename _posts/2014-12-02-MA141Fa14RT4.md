1. A farmer wants to fence an area of 24 million square feet and then divide it in half with a fence parallel to one of the sides of the rectangular area. What should the length of the two sides be to minimize fencing? 

2. A ladder 12 ft long is resting against a vertical wall. If the ladder is sliding away from the wall at 0.5 ft/sec, how quickly is the angle between the ground and ladder changing when the ladder is 4 ft from the base of the wall? 

3. A square box with an open top has a volume of 10 cubic meters. Material for the base costs $5 per square meter. Material for the sides costs $2 per square meter. What is the cost of materials for the cheapest such container? 

4. A piece of wire 10 m long is cut into 2 pieces. One piece is built into a square and the other is built into an equilateral triangle. 
	* How much wire should be used for the square in order to maximize the total area?
	* How much wire should be used for the square to minimize the total area? 

5. A flashlight lying on the ground shines on a building 15 yards away as a 5-yard tall man walks towards the same building at 2 yd/s. How fast is the length of the shadow decreasing when he is exactly half way between the flashlight and the building? 

6. Professor Blanco-Silva wants to put a poster over the blackboard in room 412 in LeConte during Exam day, since there is writing on the blackboard but no eraser can be found. The poster is a picture of a student's face to motivate us to do better on the exam. The area of the poster is to be fixed at 180 square inches with 2-inch margins on all sides. What dimensions will give the largest printed area?

9. Gravel is being dumped from a conveyor belt at a rate of  20 cubic feet per minute and forms the shape of a cone whose base, diameter and height are always equal. How fast is the height of the pile increasing when the pile is 10 ft high?
