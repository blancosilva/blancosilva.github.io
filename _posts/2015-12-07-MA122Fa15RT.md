1. The concentration of carbon dioxide, <span>\\( C=f(t) \\)</span>, in the atmosphere, in parts per million (ppm), is a function of years, *t*, since 1960.  Interpret <span>\\( f(40)=370 \\)</span>.

2. For the function <span>\\( f(x)=3x+3 \\)</span>, find <span>\\( f(7) \\)</span>.

3. Annual sales of CDs have declined since 2000. Sales were 752.5 million in 2000 and 435.6 million in 2010.

	(a)	Find a formula for annual sales, *S*, in millions of music CDs, as a linear function of the number of years, *t*, since 2000. 

	(b)	Use the formula to predict music CD sales in 2015 in million of CDs.

4. Find the slope and *y*-intercept of the line of the equation <span>\\( 12x = 6y + 4 \\)</span>.

5. The table below shows attendance at the Atlanta Braves baseball games from 2001 to 2006.
	<div>
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{array}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\text{Year} & 2001 & 2002 & 2003 & 2004 & 2005 & 2006 \\
		\hline
		\text{Att.} & 20.72 & 21.15 & 22.53 & 22.31 & 22.42 & 22.43 \\
		\hline
		\end{array}
		\end{equation*}
	</div>
	Find the average rate of change in attendance from 2001 to 2006.

6. Find the Relative Change of a population for the following changes:

	(A) From 500 to 2000

	(B) From 10000 to 5000

	(C) From 100,000 to 15,000

7. Fixed Cost: 19,000 (dollars) Variable Cost: 14 (dollars/shirt) Revenue: 32 (dollars/shirt). Compute cost function, revenue function, profit function, graph and find break-even point.

8. Find the relative rate of change in the price of a $44.99 pair of shorts if the sale price is $29.45.

9. The population, *P*, in millions of Nicaragua was 6.3 million in 2006 and growing at an annual rate of 3.9%   Let *t* be time in years since 2006.

	(a) express *P* as a function <span>\\( P=P_0 A^t \\)</span>.

    (b) express *P* as an exponential function using base *e*.

    (c) compare the annual and continuous growth rates.

10. The EPA invested a spill of radioactive iodine. The radiation level at the site was 1.6 milirems per hour. The level of radiation decays at a rate of <span>\\( k= -0.05 \\)<span>. 

	+ the level of radiation 24 hours later? 

	+ number of hours until the level of radiation reached the max acceptable limit (0.6 milirems per hour).
