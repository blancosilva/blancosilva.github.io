I know it is hard to grasp, but it is a _mathematically viable_: there are solids that require an infinite amount of material to construct, yet they have no volume!  Of course, the obvious infinity surface area make it impossible to actually construct these objects physically, but it is feasible to come up with reasonable approximations.  One approximation to such a construction---the so-called Menger sponge---goes like this:

1. Start with a big cube.  Visualize this cube as \\( 3 \times 3 \times = 27 \\) smaller cubes with the same shape and size---like a Rubik's cube!  Remove now the small center cube of each side, and the small cube at the center.  We are left with a structure consisting on 20 cubes: those at the corners and the _edge cubes_ connecting them.
2. Repeat this process on each of these 20 cubes.  We are left with 400 smaller cubes.
3. Repeat again (8,000 cubes), and again (160,000 cubes), and again (3,200,000 cubes), ...

After three steps of this process we already observe an elegant geometrical marvel.

This object was first described by Karl Menger in the 1920's, while a student at the University of Vienna.  After the end of World War II, Menger accepted a position at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he contributed to beautiful mathematics in the fields of probabilistic and hyperbolic geometry.

In the early 1990's Dr. Jeannine Mosley---an electrical engineer from MIT, with bast experience in computer graphics designing 3D modeling software---had the brilliant idea of creating the level 3 of this sponge by paper folding.  The building blocks of this monster being simple cubes, that one could carefully assemble from six pieces of sturdy-enough pieces of paper.  All these pieces needed to have exactly the same shape and size, naturally.  For ten years, she patiently coordinated a very ambitious project where several teams carefully folded thousands of business cards into more and more complex shapes.
