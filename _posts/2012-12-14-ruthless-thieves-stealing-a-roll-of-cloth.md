<div class="well">
	Some thieves stole a long roll of silk cloth from a warehouse.  In a bush far from the warehouse, they counted the length of the cloth.  If each thief gets 6 <em>hiki</em>, then 6 <em>hiki</em> is left over, but if each thief takes 7 <em>hiki</em> then the last thief gets no cloth at all.  Find the number of thieves and the length of the cloth.
