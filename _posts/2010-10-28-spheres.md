The unit sphere in any <span>\\( d \\)</span>–dimensional space <span>\\( \mathbb{R}^d \\)</span> is defined to be the set <span>\\( \mathbb{S}\_{d-1} = \big\\{ (x\_1,x\_2,\dotsc,x\_d) \in \mathbb{R}^d : \sum\_{k=1}^d x\_k^2=1 \big\\}. \\)</span>  The 1-dimensional sphere is, of course, the circle, that we can parametrize by angles:

<div>
\begin{equation}
 \varphi \colon [0,2\pi) \in \theta \mapsto e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \equiv (\cos \theta, \sin \theta) \in \mathbb{S}_1 
 \end{equation}
</div>

While understanding the definition of homeomorphism, we worked on such a map from a disk <span>\\( D_2 \\)</span> to a square <span>\\( \square_2. \\)</span>  In this section we are going to use this idea to establish a homeomorphism between the 2-dimensional sphere <span>\\( \mathbb{S}_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3 \\)</span>, and the quotient space formed by a proper identification of points in the border of a square <span>\\( \square_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^2. \\)</span>  The construction goes as follows:

1. Scale the unit sphere by a half, and shift it vertically up by half unit, so the center is at <span>\\( (0,0,\frac{1}{2}). \\)</span>
2. The plane <span>\\( \{ x_3=0\} \\)</span> intersects this sphere at the origin.  We identify this point with the center of the disk <span>\\( D_2. \\)</span>
3. For each <span>\\( 0 \leq \lambda < 1, \\)</span> the horizontal plane <span>\\( \{x_3=\lambda\} \\)</span> intersects this sphere in the circle <span>\\( \big\\{ (x\_1,x\_2,\lambda) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x\_1^2 + x\_2^2 + (\lambda - \frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{4} \big\\}: \\)</span> the center is at <span>\\( (0,0,\lambda), \\)</span> and the radius is <span>\\( \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}-(\lambda-\frac{1}{2})^2}. \\)</span><br />
We consider a map that scales this circle to that of radius <span>\\( \lambda, \\)</span> and "places it" on the unit disk <span>\\( D_2 \\)</span> in a natural way.  So far, the map so constructed is injective, onto and continuous.
4. The issue now is what to do with the last non-void intersection of the sphere with horizontal planes.  This happens at the horizontal plane <span>\\( \{ x_3 = 1\}, \\)</span> and the result is the only point <span>\\( (0,0,1). \\)</span>  We overcome this situation by mapping the whole point into the last circle in <span>\\( D_2 \\)</span>, and identifying the whole circle.  We accomplish this by creating the equivalence relation <span>\\( (x_1,x_2) \sim (y_1,y_2) \\)</span> defined by the following rules:

	1. <span>\\( x_1=y_1 \\)</span> and <span>\\( x_2=y_2, \\)</span> or
	2. <span>\\( x_1^2+x_2^2=y_1^2+y_2^2=1. \\)</span>


We have thus created a homeomorphism <span>\\( \varphi_1 \colon \mathbb{S}_2 \to D_2. \\)</span>  Compose this with an homeomorphism <span>\\( \varphi \colon D_2 \to \square_2, \\)</span> and notice that the equivalence relation defined above turns into the equivalence relation <span>\\( (x_1,x_2) \sim (y_1,y_2) \\)</span> defined by the following rules:

1. <span>\\( x_1=y_1 \\)</span> and <span>\\( x_2=y_2 \\)</span>, or
2. <span>\\( \mathop{\text{max}}\big(\lvert x_1\rvert, \lvert x_2\rvert \big) = \mathop{\text{max}}\big( \lvert y_1\rvert, \lvert y_2\rvert \big) = 1. \\)</span>

Graphically, we represent this set with the diagram below:
