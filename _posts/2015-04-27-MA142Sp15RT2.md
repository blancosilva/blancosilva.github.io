<div class="well">
	<h3>Sections 5 and 6</h3>
	
	<p>The part on convergence of series is a bit small for my taste.  There are so many different possible examples for each convergence test, but you have chosen just one or two.  I will be more imaginative in my final.  Please do work some extra problems on this topic from the assigned HW in the syllabus, and online.</p>

	<p>Same for sequences.  I wish I had seen some more interesting examples, with varied difficulty and challenges.</p>

	<p>The problems for power series that you presented are really good.  There is a good variety in the selection, with different difficulty levels.  There is one evil problem out there (thanks Emmy?).  Unfortunately, you have missed about 50% of the material. I    would have liked to see more problems on finding the <strong>interval of convergence</strong> of a few series that are not expressed as standard functions.  I did modify one of the problems to address this situation.  As before, I will be much more imaginative in my final.</p>
</div>

1. Explore the convergence (absolute or conditional) or divergence of the following series.  
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		& \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{6^n+8}{11^{n+1}+27} &
		& \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{4n^4+4n^2+3}{\sqrt{n^7+5}} &
		& \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{5n+2} \\
		& \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^3+8}} &
		& \sum_{n=1}^\infty \bigg( \frac{6n+2}{3n+5} \bigg)^n &
		& \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^2 \frac{3n^2+4}{n!} \\
		& \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\ln n}{n} &
		& \sum_{n=50}^\infty ne^{-n} 
		\end{align}
	</div>

2. Find the following sums (an exact value).  Show work.
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(2e)^n}{6^{n-1}} &&
		\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+2)(n+3)}
		\end{align}
	</div>

3. Find a formula for the general term of the sequence that starts <span>\\( 4, -\frac{8}{5}, \frac{16}{25}, -\frac{32}{125}, \dotsc \\)</span>
	

4. Study the convergence of the following sequence.
	<div>
		\begin{equation}
		\left\{ \frac{5e^n + e^{-2n}}{6+e^{3n}} \right\}_{n=1}^\infty
		\end{equation}
	</div>

5. Express the following sums as power series, and indicate what is the center and radius of convergence.

	<div>
		\begin{align}
		f(x) &= \frac{1}{5-x} &
		f(x) &= \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\
		f(x) &= 7\pi \tan^{-1} x &
		f(x) &= \frac{x^2}{(1-x)^3} \\
		f(x) &= \frac{3}{x^2-x-2} &
		f(x) &= \frac{x^8}{x^2-4}
		\end{align}
	</div>

6. Find the interval of convergence of the following series:

	<div>
		\begin{equation}
		\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{n^n x^n}{n!}
		\end{equation}
	</div>

7. Find a Taylor series representation of <span>\\( f(x) = \sin x \\)</span> around <span>\\( a=\pi/2 \\)</span>.
