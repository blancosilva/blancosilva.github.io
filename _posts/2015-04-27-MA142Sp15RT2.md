<div class="well">
	<h3>Sections 5 and 6</h3>
	
	<p>The part on convergence of series is a bit small for my taste.  There are so many different possible examples for each convergence test, but you have chosen just one or two.  I will be more imaginative in my final.  Please do work some extra problems on this topic from the assigned HW in the syllabus, and online.</p>

	<p>Same for sequences.  I wish I had seen some more interesting examples, with varied difficulty and challenges.</p>
</div>

1. Explore the convergence (absolute or conditional) or divergence of the following series.  
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		& \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{6^n+8}{11^{n+1}+27} &
		& \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{4n^4+4n^2+3}{\sqrt{n^7+5}} &
		& \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{5n+2} \\
		& \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{n}{\sqrt{n^3+8}} &
		& \sum_{n=1}^\infty \bigg( \frac{6n+2}{3n+5} \bigg)^n &
		& \sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^2 \frac{3n^2+4}{n!} \\
		& \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\ln n}{n} &
		& \sum_{n=50}^\infty ne^{-n} 
		\end{align}
	</div>

2. Find the following sums (an exact value).  Show work.
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(2e)^n}{6^{n-1}} &&
		\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{(n+2)(n+3)}
		\end{align}
	</div>

3. Find a formula for the general term of the sequence that starts <div>$4, -\dfrac{8}{5}, \frac{16}{25}, -\dfrac{32}{125}, \dotsc$</div>
	

4. Study the convergence of the following sequence.
	<div>
		\begin{equation}
		\left\{ \frac{5e^n + e^{-2n}}{6+e^{3n}} \right\}_{n=1}^\infty
		\end{equation}
	</div>
