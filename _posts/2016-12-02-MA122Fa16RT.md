	<h3>Algebra Review and Initial Applications.  Section 003</h3>

	<p>This is a good first review, although I am missing a few questions on solving exponential/logarithmic equations, or dealing with exponential functions in general.  I would like to have seen also some questions exploring the relation between the constants <i>k</i>, <i>r</i> and <i>a</i>.  Otherwise, this is a fine selection.  4/5</p>

	<h3>Antiderivatives.  Section 003</h3>

	<p>Decent, straightforward selection of integrals, with different difficulty levels.  I liked it.  Two students managed to write integrals that didn't make sense, or integrals that need to be solved with techniques that are not taught in MATH 122.  Those students will not get any credit, instead of lowering everybody's score for this part.  A solid 5/5</p>  

	<h3>Antiderivatives.  Section 019</h3>
	<p>The selection of this group was dissapointing.  Very basic antiderivatives, without any real variation.  Not representative of the depth and dificulty of the problems we have done in class.  2/5.</p>

	&\int \frac{x^2}{x^3+1}\, dx &&\int (x+1)\big( \tfrac{x^2}{2}+x \big)\, dx &&\int \frac{x-10}{x}\, dx \\
	&\int 6x^2 e^{x^3}\, dx &&\int 4^{3x}\, dx &&\int (3x-2) (3x^2 -4x +5)^{26}\, dx
