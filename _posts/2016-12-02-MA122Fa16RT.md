	<h3>Algebra Review and Initial Applications.  Section 003</h3>

	<p>This is a good first review, although I am missing a few questions on solving exponential/logarithmic equations, or dealing with exponential functions in general.  I would like to have seen also some questions exploring the relation between the constants <i>k</i>, <i>r</i> and <i>a</i>.  Otherwise, this is a fine selection.  4/5</p>

	<h3>Algebra Review and Initial Applications.  Section 019</h3>

	<p>Much better selection of problems, and all topics and skills have been properly addressed.  I prefer the applications of the other section, but yours are not bad.  5/5</p>
