Problem 1.

1. \\( y^2 = Cx + D. \\)
2. \\( x^2 + y^2 = C. \\)
3. \\( y^2 = Ce^x. \\)
4. \\( y = C - x. \\)
5. \\( \ln \lvert x \rvert = C - \tfrac{1}{x}. \\)
6. \\( x^2 - y^2 = C. \\)
7. Two possible solutions: \\( y^2 \pm 2y^2 = C. \\)
8. I suspect there is a typo in the statement of this problem, because this one is pretty tough.  I got it reduced to
   the equation \\( (x-y'-y)^2 (y')^2= y^2 \big( 1+ (y')^2 \big) \\).  We'd have to find all solutions of this equation
   for \\( y' \\), and then solve each of those differential equations independently.  **ANGTFT**

Problem 2.

1. \\( y = 2x+C. \\)
2. \\( \lvert y \rvert = C \sqrt[n]{\lvert x \rvert}. \\)
3. \\( y^2 = \tfrac{2}{n}x^2 + C. \\)
4. \\( \lvert y \rvert = Cx^2. \\)
5. We'll do this one later on.  Focus on the ones for which we have discussed the method \\( F(x,y) = C. \\)
6. \\( y^2 = x + C. \\)
7. Pretty tough. \\( \big( \tfrac{y^2}{x^2}+1 \big) \big( \tfrac{y^2}{x^2}+2 \big)^{-1/2} = Ce^{-x}. \\)
8. \\( \tfrac{1}{y-x} - \ln \big( 1-\tfrac{1}{y-x} \big) = C-x. \\)
9. One solution is \\( y = 0. \\) The other is \\( \tfrac{2}{3}x^3 + xy^2 = C. \\)
