	<h3>Sections 11 and 12</h3>

	So so... <br /> 

	I would have liked to see more limits with square roots of the form <span>\\( 0/0 \\)</span>, and limits that do not exist, but the ones you presented are ok.  <br />

	I am also missing some nice exponential and logarithmic equationsâ€”they will be an important part of this portion of the final exam. <br />

	None of the problems involved sign charts.  Do not forget about those!  <br />

	Another thing I am missing is shifts, stretching, compression, mirror images...<br />

	The problem on composition is good, but I would have liked to see the computation of some domains of compositions as well.  <br />

	There was a repeated topic, and one question that did not make any sense.  I dismissed those two questions.
</div>

1. Find the domain of the function
	<div>
		\begin{equation}
		f(x) = \frac{3x-7}{4x-5}	
		\end{equation}
	</div>
2. Given <span>\\( f(x) = x^2-5, g(x) = 7x=15 \\)</span>, find <span>\\( f(g(x)), f(x)/g(x), f(f(x)), g(g(x)) \\)</span>, and <span>\\( f(x)-g(x) \\)</span>.
3. Evaluate <span>\\( \log_2 80 - \log_2 5 \\)</span>.	
4. Compute the following limits:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		&\lim_{x\to -2}	\frac{x+2}{x^3+8} \\
		&\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{(7+h)^2-49}{h} \\
		&\lim_{x\to -2^+} \frac{x+1}{x+2} \\
		&\lim_{x\to 2} \sqrt[3]{x^5 -3x^2 +7}
		\end{align}
	</div>
5. For what values of the constant <span>\\( C \\)</span> is the function <span>\\( f(x) \\)</span> continuous in <span>\\( (-\infty, \infty) \\)</span>?
	<div>
		\begin{equation}
		f(x) = \begin{cases} Cx^2 +2x &\text{ if } x<2 \\ x^3-Cx &\text{ if } x\geq 2 \end{cases}
		\end{equation}
	</div>

	<h3> Sections 15 and 16</h3>
	This is a much better selection of limits and a far more challenging selection of domains.  I like that you also tried some intuitive ranges.  Good for you!  <br />

	Your logarithmic equations are <strong>evil</strong>: I did enjoy that very much. <br />

	I thoroughly enjoyed the diversity of problems, and the careful choices of functions, to avoid repetition.  Amazing team work.  Expect a bunch of extra credit for this exam.
</div>

1. Find domain and range of the following functions:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		f(x) &= -\sqrt{x} - 2 \\
		f(x) &= -\sqrt{49-x^2}	\\

2. Compute the following limits:
	<div>

		&\lim_{x\to 1^+} \frac{x-1}{x^2-1} \\
		&\lim_{x\to 2} \frac{x^2+x-6}{x-2} \\
		&\lim_{x\to 0^-} \frac{\sqrt{x+1}-1}{x} \\
		&\lim_{x\to 3} -\frac{19}{3-x} \\
		&\lim_{x\to -1} \frac{2x^2+2}{x^2+4x-4} \\
