## Relations

<div class="alert alert-info"> 
The following is the list of problems for sections 11.0 and 11.1 of the <em>Book of Proof</em> (pages 178 and 182).
There is a forum open at the end, so you can ask questions.  It is a great way to interact with the instructor and with
other students in your class, should you need some assistance with any question. Please, <strong>do not post
solutions</strong>.

### Exercises for Section 11.0

2. Let \\( A = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}. \\) Write out the relation \\( R \\) that expresses \\( \vert \\) (divides) on
   \\( A. \\)  Then illustrate it with a diagram.
3. Let \\( A = \\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \\}. \\)  Write out the relation \\( R \\) that expresses \\( \geq \\) on \\( A. \\)
   Then illustrate it with a diagram.

6. Congruence modulo 5 is a relation on the set \\( A = \mathbb{Z}. \\)  In this relation \\( xRy \\) means \\( x \equiv
   y \pmod{5}. \\)  Write out the set \\( R \\) in set-builder notation.
7. Write the relation \\( < \\) on the set \\( A = \mathbb{Z} \\) as a subset \\( R \\) of \\( \mathbb{Z} \times
   \mathbb{Z}. \\)  This is an infinite set, so you will have to use set-builder notation.
8. Let \\( A = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}.  \\)  Observe that \\( \emptyset \subseteq A \times A, \\) so \\( R = \emptyset
   \\) is a relation on \\( A. \\)  Draw a diagram of this relation.
9. Let \\( A = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}. \\)  How many different relations are there on the set \\( A \\)?
10. Consider the subset \\( R = ( \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} ) \setminus \\{ (x,x) : x \in \mathbb{R} \\} \subseteq
\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}.  \\) What familiar relation on \\( \mathbb{R} \\) is this?
11. Given a finite set \\( A, \\) how many different relations are there on \\( A \\)?

6. Consider the relation \\( R = \\{ (x,x) : x \in \mathbb{Z} \\} \\) on \\( \mathbb{Z}. \\)
   Is \\( R \\) reflexive?  Symmetric? Transitive?  If a property does not hold, say why.  What familiar relation is this?
7. There are 16 possible different relations on the set \\( A = \\{ a, b \\}.  \\) Describe all of them.  (A picture of
   each will suffice, but don't forget to label the nodes.)  Which ones are reflexive? Symmetric? Transitive?
8. Define a relation on \\( \mathbb{Z} \\) as \\( x\operatorname{R}y \\) if \\( \lvert x-y \rvert < 1. \\)  
   Is \\( R \\) reflexive?  Symmetric? Transitive?  If a property does not hold, say why.  What familiar relation is
   this?
9. Define a relation on \\( \mathbb{Z} \\) by declaring \\( x \operatorname{R} y \\) if and only if \\( x \\) and \\( y
   \\) have the same parity.     Is \\( R \\) reflexive?  Symmetric? Transitive?  If a property does not hold, say why.
   What familiar relation is this?
10. Suppose \\( A \neq \emptyset. \\)  Since \\( \emptyset \subseteq A \times A, \\) the set \\( R = \emptyset \\) is a
    relation on \\( A. \\)    Is \\( R \\) reflexive?  Symmetric? Transitive?  If a property does not hold, say why.
11. Suppose \\( A = \\{ a, b, c, d \\} \\) and \\( R = \\{ (a,a), (b,b), (c,c), (d,d) \\}. \\) Is \\( R \\) reflexive?
    Symmetric? Transitive?  If a property does not hold, say why.
12. Prove that the relation \\( \vert \\) (divides) on the set \\( \mathbb{Z} \\) is reflexive and transitive.  (Use
    example 11.8 as a guide if you are unsure on how to proceed.)
13. Consider the relation \\( R = \\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} : x - y \in \mathbb{Z} \\} \\) on \\(
    \mathbb{R}. \\)  Prove that this relation is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.
14. Suppose \\( R \\) is a symmetric and transitive relation on a set \\( A, \\)  and there is an element \\( a \in A
    \\) for which \\( a \operatorname{R} x \\) for every \\( x \in A. \\)   Prove that \\( R \\) is reflexive.
15. Prove or disprove:  If a relation is symmetric and transitive, then it is also reflexive.
16. Define a relation \\( R \\) on \\( \mathbb{Z} \\) by declaring that \\( x \operatorname{R} y \\) if and only if \\(

    Transitive?
18. The table on page 179 shows that relations on \\( \mathbb{Z} \\) may obey various combinations of the reflexive,
    symmetric and transitive properties.  In all, there are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) possible combinations, and the table shows 5
    of them.  (There is some redundancy, as \\( \leq \\) and \\( \vert \\) have the same type.)  Complete the table by
    finding examples of relations on \\( \mathbb{Z} \\) for the three missing combinations.
