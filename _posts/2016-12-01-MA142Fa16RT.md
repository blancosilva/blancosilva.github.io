<div class="well">
	<h3>Parametric and Polar equations</h3>

	All the different skills seem to be there, except the computation of lengths of curves given in parametric.  Make sure to study that part too.  Most of the problems are moderate-to-easy.  Remember that in your final exam I may offer a problem that requires integration of a function that cannot be carried by a calculator---make sure to work those problems with and without calculator.

	A couple of problem proposals were poorly written, came with typos, or didn't carry interesting variation of examples (too repetitive).  All in all, I would give this section a 3/5.
</div>

1. Find 4 different instances of points in polar coordinates that represent the point in Cartesian coordinates given by <span>\\( x=3, y=3. \\)</span>

2. Convert the point given in polar coordinates by <span>\\( (5, 3\pi/2) \\)</span> into Cartesian coordinates.

3. Convert the polar equation, <span>\\( r = 6 \cos\theta \\)</span>, into a parametric equation.

4. Convert the polar equation, <span>\\( 6/r = 5\cos\theta + \tfrac{1}{3}\csc\theta \\)</span>, into a parametric equation. 

[<strong>I like this problem!  It is evil.  Good luck getting a solution.</strong>]

5. Convert the following curves (given in polar coordinates) into parametric equations:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		&r^2 = 4 \\
		&r\cos\theta = 17
		\end{align}
	</div>

5. Compute the tangent line to the curve given in parametric equations by <span>\\( x(t) = \cos^2 t, \\)</span> <span>\\( y(t) = 2\sin t \\)</span> at <span>\\( t = \pi/6 \\)</span>

4. Find a parametrization for the line segment from <span>\\( (0,1) \\)</span> to <span>\\( (4,0). \\)</span>

5. Without using a calculator, sketch the graph of the curve given in parametric equations by <span>\\( x(t) = 2t-5, \\)</span> <span>\\( y(t) = 4t-7, \\)</span>  <span>\\( 1 \leq t \leq 3 \\)</span>

6. Express in polar coordinates the curves given in implicit form by <span>\\( x^2/16 + y^2/9 = 1 \\)<span> and <span>\\( 3x-2y=6. \\)<span>

7. Find the length of the following curves:
	<div>
		\begin{align}
		r &= \theta^2, && 0 \leq \theta \leq \sqrt{5} \\
		r &= \cos^3 \tfrac{\theta}{3}, && 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/4 \\
		\end{align}
	</div>	

8. Compute the area of the region bounded by <span>\\( r = \sin\theta,  0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi. \\)</span>

10. Compute the area of the region bounded by <span>\\( r = 4 + \cos 2\theta, \pi/8 \leq \theta \leq \pi. \\)<span>

11. Compute the area of the region bounded by the astroid <span>\\( x(t) = \cos^3 t, \\)</span> <span>\\( y(t) = \sin^3 t, \\)<span> <span>\\( 0 \leq t \leq 2\pi. \\)</span>
