<div class="well">
	The choice of problems on optimization is ok.  But I am missing a few topics.  
	<ul>
		<li>There are three kinds of integrals by substitution, but you only chose one.</li>
		<li>We worked many different problems of the application of optimization to marginal analysis in class.  I will ask a few of those in the final.</li>
	</ul>
	Also, I don't recall doing any problem like number 3, where you mess with high degree polynomials.

1. Find any local min or max of the functions <span>\\( f(x) = x^2-8x+4 \\)</span> using the first derivative test.
2. The function <span>\\( f(x)=x^4-3x^3+5 \\)</span> has a critical point at <span>\\( x=1 \\)</span>.  Use the second derivative test to identify it as a local max or local min.
3. Find any critical points of the function <span>\\( f(x) = 6x^5 + 33x^4 -30x+100 \\)</span>.
4. Find any inflection points of the function <span>\\( f(x) = 2x^3+3x^2-180x+3 \\)</span>.
5. Find constants <span>\\( a \\)</span> and <span>\\( b \\)</span> so the minimum of the parabola <span>\\( f(x) = x^2+ax+b \\)</span> is at the point <span>\\( (6,2) \\)</span>.
6. Find the global maximum and minimum of the function <span>\\( f(x) = 2x^3-3x^2-12x+3 \\)</span> on the interval <span>\\( [-2, 4] \\)</span>.
7. Let <span>\\( C(q) \\)</span> represent the cost and <span>\\( R(q) \\)</span> represent the revenue, in dollars, of production of <span>\\( q \\)</span> items.
* If <span>\\( C(50)=4300 \\)</span> and <span>\\( C'(50)=24 \\)</span>, estimate <span>\\( C(52) \\)</span>.
* If <span>\\( C'(50)=24 \\)</span> and <span>\\( R'(50)=35 \\)</span>, approximately how much profit is earned by the 51st item?
* If <span>\\( C'(100)=38 \\)</span> and <span>\\( R'(100)=35 \\)</span>, should the company produce de 101st item? Why or why not?
8. Find the following antiderivatives:
<div>
	\begin{equation}
	\int x^5+x^{100}\, dx	
	\end{equation}
</div>
<div>
	\begin{equation}
	\int \frac{3}{x^{24}} + 3x^{-4} - 27x^3\, dx	
	\end{equation}
</div>
<div>
	\begin{equation}
	\int e^x - \frac{24}{x^{3/4}}\, dx	
	\end{equation}
</div>
<div>
	\begin{equation}
	\int \frac{x^2}{x^3+1}\, dx
	\end{equation}
</div>
<div>
	\begin{equation}
	\int (x+1)\big( \frac{x^2}{2}+x \big)\, dx	
	\end{equation}
</div>
